## Day 1

Cool idea (media posts on schedule), read Linked In docs to see whether it is possible to implement. Seems like it is.

The API part that interests me is: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/usecases/page-management/organic-posts-usecase?view=li-lms-2022-08. Took quite awhile to find.

## Day 3

Apparently, need to create a Linked In page (company) for getting access to the API. Did that: https://www.linkedin.com/company/clean-code-paladin/

Had to not only create the app but also verify it as an admin of the page, following these steps: https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a548360.

I also needed to request for access. Thought that would require some manual intervention and review by Linked In. But nope, it's just a button click. Can select from: learning, authenticating and marketing APIs without any questions asked.
